## 🎯 The 30-Second Brief

You're presenting "Securing the Agentic Frontier" - demonstrating how AI-assisted threat modeling found 23 critical vulnerabilities in ElizaOS (73% of deployments exposed). You'll do a 3-minute live demo of RAG Memory Poisoning, then pitch a $1.6M-$3.1M security investment that prevents $50M+ in breach costs.

## 🔑 Three Things to Memorize

### 1. The Soundbites (One Per Finding)

**Plugin Problem:**
> "Installing an AI agent plugin is equivalent to giving a stranger root access to your cloud infrastructure—except there's no audit trail."

**Prompt Injection:**
> "Unlike traditional XSS, prompt injection in AI agents can't be fixed with output encoding—it requires rethinking memory architecture from the ground up."

**Authentication Gap:**
> "Security cannot be optional. If your AI framework has an 'auth: false' config option, you WILL have breaches."

### 2. The Killer Statistics

- **73%** of ElizaOS deployments have ZERO authentication
- **23** critical vulnerabilities found (vs. 3-5 in traditional analysis)
- **$50M+** potential breach costs without fixes
- **10-13x faster** than manual threat modeling
- **151% ROI** in year 1 ($1.6M-$3.1M investment)

### 3. The Call to Action

1. Visit Booth #47 for free 30-minute threat modeling session
2. Scan QR code to download full MAESTRO analysis
3. Schedule 1:1 CISO workshop on AI security roadmap

## ⏱️ Timing Cheat Sheet

| Minutes | What to Say | Slide |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **0-2** | "Traditional AppSec fails for AI. Let me show you why." | 1-2 |
| **2-4** | "MAESTRO framework - 7 layers, 4 critical." | 3-4 |
| **4-7** | "Finding #1: Plugin RCE. Finding #2: 73% exposed." | 5-6 |
| **7-10** | **LIVE DEMO:** RAG Memory Poisoning (inject → wait → trigger → breach) | 7-10 |
| **10-13** | "$50M breach costs. Invest $1.6M-$3.1M to prevent." | 11-13 |
| **13-15** | "Visit our booth. Questions?" | 14-16 |

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Demo Fails?
1. **Plan A:** Switch to pre-recorded video (3 min)
2. **Plan B:** Show static screenshots (2 min)
3. **Plan C:** Skip demo, go straight to impact slide

### Running Out of Time?
- Skip Finding #3 details (already covered in demo)
- Cut Q&A prep (answer 1-2 questions max)
- End exactly at 15 minutes

### Technical Issues?
- WiFi down → Use mobile hotspot
- Laptop crashes → Switch to backup laptop
- Projector fails → Audience sees via AV system

## 📊 The Core Message

### Problem
AI agents are deploying at scale with traditional security controls. 73% have no authentication. Attackers are exploiting this.

### Solution
AI-native security using MAESTRO framework. Agentic threat modeling finds 4-7x more vulnerabilities, 10x faster, 85% cheaper.

### Investment
$1.6M-$3.1M over year 1 for plugin governance, authentication upgrades, and prompt security programs.

### ROI
Prevents $50M+ in breach costs. 151% ROI. 3x more projects secured with same budget.

## 💬 Opening Line (Memorize This)

"Good afternoon. Today I'm going to show you why your current security controls are inadequate for AI agent systems—and what you need to do about it before your competitors exploit this gap. By the end of this talk, you'll understand the three critical vulnerabilities affecting 73% of AI deployments, and you'll see a live attack that can't be stopped by traditional defenses."

---

## 🎬 Closing Line (Memorize This)

"The question isn't whether your competitors are deploying AI agents—it's whether they're doing it securely. This is your opportunity to lead. Visit booth 47, scan the QR code, and let's build your AI security roadmap together. Thank you. I have 5 minutes for questions."
