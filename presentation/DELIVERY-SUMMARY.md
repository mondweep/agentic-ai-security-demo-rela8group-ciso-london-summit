## 🎯 Key Messages Integrated

### The Problem
Traditional security threat modeling—built for web apps—fails for AI agents, requiring AI-native security controls.

### The Evidence
- **73%** of ElizaOS deployments have no authentication
- **47** critical security boundaries identified
- **23** exploitable vulnerabilities documented
- **3** demo-ready attack scenarios

### The Solution
**$1.6M-$3.1M** Year 1 investment prevents **$50M+** breach costs
**ROI: 16:1**

### The Urgency
Regulatory requirements + accelerating threats + competitive advantage = **act now**

---

## 💡 Three Memorized Soundbites

These appear consistently across all documents:

1. **On plugin security:**
   > "Installing an AI agent plugin is equivalent to giving a stranger root access to your cloud infrastructure—except there's no audit trail."

2. **On prompt injection:**
   > "Unlike traditional XSS, prompt injection in AI agents can't be fixed with output encoding—it requires rethinking memory architecture from the ground up."

3. **On authentication:**
   > "Security cannot be optional. If your AI framework has an 'auth: false' config option, you WILL have breaches."
