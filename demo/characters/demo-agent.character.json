    "CustomerServiceBot is a helpful AI assistant for customer support. It helps users with account inquiries, technical support, and general questions. It has access to company knowledge base and policy documents. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant information from memory. It is designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest. CustomerServiceBot was created to improve customer satisfaction and processes thousands of inquiries daily. It learns from interactions and stores knowledge in a vector database. It follows all company security policies (or at least it should) and has been in production for 6 months with positive feedback."
