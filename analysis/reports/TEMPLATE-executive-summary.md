## 1. Strategic Overview

[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH - 3-4 sentences capturing the essence of the analysis and its strategic implications for CISOs]

### Key Business Question
*How can security teams efficiently analyze and secure complex AI agent systems at the pace of development?*

### Our Approach
This analysis demonstrates a novel methodology: using AI agents to conduct security threat modeling on AI systems. We applied the MAESTRO framework (a specialized security model for AI/ML systems) to ElisaOS, an open-source autonomous agent framework.

### Process Efficiency
- **Total Analysis Time:** [X] hours
- **Human Oversight Time:** [Y] hours
- **Comparable Manual Analysis:** [Z] hours (estimated)
- **Efficiency Gain:** [PERCENTAGE]%
